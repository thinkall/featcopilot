# FeatCopilot 🚀

**Next-Generation LLM-Powered Auto Feature Engineering Framework**

FeatCopilot automatically generates, selects, and explains predictive features using semantic understanding. It analyzes column meanings, applies domain-aware transformations, and provides human-readable explanations—turning raw data into ML-ready features in seconds.

## Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install featcopilot

# With LLM capabilities
pip install featcopilot[llm]

# Full installation
pip install featcopilot[full]
```

## Quick Start

### Fast Mode (Tabular Only)

```python
from featcopilot import AutoFeatureEngineer

# Sub-second feature engineering
engineer = AutoFeatureEngineer(
    engines=['tabular'],
    max_features=50
)

X_transformed = engineer.fit_transform(X, y)  # <1 second
print(f"Features: {X.shape[1]} -> {X_transformed.shape[1]}")
```

### LLM Mode (With LiteLLM)

```python
from featcopilot import AutoFeatureEngineer

# LLM-powered semantic features (+19.66% max improvement)
engineer = AutoFeatureEngineer(
    engines=['tabular', 'llm'],
    max_features=50
)

X_transformed = engineer.fit_transform(
    X, y,
    column_descriptions={
        'age': 'Customer age in years',
        'income': 'Annual household income in USD',
        'tenure': 'Months as customer',
    },
    task_description="Predict customer churn"
)  # 30-60 seconds

# Get LLM-generated explanations
for feature, explanation in engineer.explain_features().items():
    print(f"{feature}: {explanation}")
```

## Engines

### Tabular Engine
Generates polynomial features, interaction terms, and mathematical transformations.

```python
from featcopilot.engines import TabularEngine

engine = TabularEngine(
    polynomial_degree=2,
    interaction_only=False,
    include_transforms=['log', 'sqrt', 'square']
)
```

### Time Series Engine
Extracts statistical, frequency, and temporal features from time series data.

```python
from featcopilot.engines import TimeSeriesEngine

engine = TimeSeriesEngine(
    features=['mean', 'std', 'skew', 'autocorr', 'fft_coefficients']
)
```

### LLM Engine
Uses GitHub Copilot SDK (default) or LiteLLM (100+ providers) for intelligent feature generation.

```python
from featcopilot.llm import SemanticEngine

# Default: GitHub Copilot SDK
engine = SemanticEngine(
    model='gpt-5.2',
    max_suggestions=20,
    validate_features=True
)

# Alternative: LiteLLM backend
engine = SemanticEngine(
    model='gpt-4o',
    backend='litellm',
    max_suggestions=20
)
```

## Feature Selection

```python
from featcopilot.selection import FeatureSelector

selector = FeatureSelector(
    methods=['mutual_info', 'importance', 'correlation'],
    max_features=30,
    correlation_threshold=0.95
)

X_selected = selector.fit_transform(X, y)
```
